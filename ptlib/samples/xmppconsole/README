This is a simple application to examine the operation of XMPP in a 
console environment.

It is a very very simple application, and the best explanation is to
say that it allows you to send jabber messages between different
applications. I will illustrate with the following example::

Simple mode of operation to see it all in operation.

Open 3 consoles.

In each console, run the program with the following command line::

xmpp -p myPassword -j myJabberId  -u myUserName


myPassword is the password associated with your jabber ID

myJabberid could be something like derek@indranet.co.nz

myUserName could be something like BigD

After everyting has run.

Do R to list nodes 
 I see::
Node 1 of 3 is derek@jabber.indranet.co.nz/38703554721123119327849277
Node 2 of 3 is derek@jabber.indranet.co.nz/37270709521123119663547752
Node 3 of 3 is derek@jabber.indranet.co.nz/2225504041123119697216062


then 
 d 3 pigs can fly


In the destination machine, you see the message:
 Message received. Subject:pigs    body:can fly  from: derek@jabber.indranet.co.nz/36632012421123119331508316
 


You are welcome to read the code, change the source etc.

Please constribute any changes back to the group by sending the
revised application, or a patch file to the openh323 mailing list.

Thanks,
 Derek Smithies.
